# 🚀 Mini Projects Vue

This repository contains a collection of small projects developed with **Vue.js**. Each project covers different features and scenarios to help improve understanding and usage of Vue.js in web applications. New projects will be added as development progresses.

## 📂 Current Projects

### 1. 🍔🦀 Self Service Machine (Krusty Krab Self-Order System)

The **Self Service Machine** simulates a self-service system like those used in restaurants like McDonald's, but at the bottom of the sea. In this project, the user can view available products, adjust quantities and see the order summary. This is the first project in the collection and was developed with the following features:

#### 🔧 Features:

- **Vue.js 3** for dynamic rendering and state management.
- A simple interface where customers can view the product menu.
- Quantity manipulation for each item in the order.
- Display of a list of products and their prices.
- Automatic calculation of the order total based on the user's selections.

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

- **Vue.js 3** via CDN
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structure and styling
- **JavaScript** for logic and state management

### 2. 🎧 Spotify Song Search

The **Spotify Song Search** allows users to search for song information using the Spotify API. This project fetches data such as the song's name, album, artist(s), duration, and popularity based on user input. It provides a dynamic and interactive interface to explore Spotify's music database.

#### 🔧 Features:

- **Vue.js 3** for dynamic rendering and API integration.
- Integration with the **Spotify API** for real-time song information retrieval.
- A responsive input form where users enter the song name to search.

- **JavaScript** for API calls and logic handling
- **Spotify API** for accessing song data

#### ⚠️ Important Note:

To run this project, you need to create your own Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret). If you prefer, you can use my API credentials—just send me a message on my social media profiles [Profile](https://github.com/Agos091), which are linked on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agos-dalcin-rufino-a9913821a/).

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project:

1. Clone this repository:
