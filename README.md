# 🚀 Mini Projects Vue

This repository contains a collection of small projects developed with **Vue.js**. Each project covers different features and scenarios to help improve understanding and usage of Vue.js in web applications. New projects will be added as development progresses.

## 📂 Current Projects

### 1. 🍔🦀 Self Service Machine (Krusty Krab Self-Order System)

The **Self Service Machine** simulates a self-service system like those used in restaurants like McDonald's, but at the bottom of the sea. In this project, the user can view available products, adjust quantities and see the order summary. This is the first project in the collection and was developed with the following features:

#### 🔧 Features:

- **Vue.js 3** for dynamic rendering and state management.
- A simple interface where customers can view the product menu.
- Quantity manipulation for each item in the order.
- Display of a list of products and their prices.
- Automatic calculation of the order total based on the user's selections.

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

- **Vue.js 3** via CDN
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structure and styling
- **JavaScript** for logic and state management

### 2. 🎧 Spotify Song Search

The **Spotify Song Search** allows users to search for song information using the Spotify API. This project fetches data such as the song's name, album, artist(s), duration, and popularity based on user input. It provides a dynamic and interactive interface to explore Spotify's music database.

#### 🔧 Features:

- **Vue.js 3** for dynamic rendering and API integration.
- Integration with the **Spotify API** for real-time song information retrieval.
- A responsive input form where users enter the song name to search.
- Display of detailed song information, including:

  - Album name
  - Artists
  - Duration (in minutes and seconds)
  - Popularity score
  - Album cover image

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

- **Vue.js 3** via CDN
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for responsive structure and styling
- **JavaScript** for API calls and logic handling
- **Spotify API** for accessing song data

#### ⚠️ Important Note:

To run this project, you need to create your own Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret). If you prefer, you can use my API credentials—just send me a message on my social media profiles [Profile](https://github.com/Agos091), which are linked on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agos-dalcin-rufino-a9913821a/).

### 3. ✅ Todo App

The **Todo App** is a simple task management application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and manage their list of todos. This project demonstrates the use of Vue.js for data binding, state management, and interaction with the browser's local storage.

#### 🔧 Features:

- **Vue.js 3** for dynamic rendering and state management.
- Input field for users to add new tasks.
- A list displaying tasks, with the ability to mark them as done.
- Tasks are saved in the browser's **local storage** so they persist even after refreshing the page.
